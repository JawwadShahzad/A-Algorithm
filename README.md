# Snake Game with BFS

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python, with an additional feature of using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path for the snake to follow.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JawwadShahzad/Snake-game.git
   cd Snake-game

## Controls
Arrow Keys: Control the direction of the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
Spacebar: Pause/Resume the game
## Algorithm
This project uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path for the snake to follow. The BFS algorithm explores all possible paths from the snake's current position to the target (food) and selects the shortest one.
